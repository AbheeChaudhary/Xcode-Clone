# Xcode Clone Project

This project is a SwiftUI-based clone of the Xcode IDE interface, showcasing navigation, file management, and console output functionality. The application includes features for managing files, toggling navigation and console areas, and resizing them. It mimics the Xcode IDE layout with a modern design and interactive interface.

## Features

- **Navigator Area**: Displays a list of files (e.g., Swift files). Users can open and select files, with a dynamic and resizable navigation area.
- **File Tabs**: Manage open files through tabs at the top. The selected file is highlighted and shown in the editor.
- **Console**: A bottom panel that shows system messages. Users can toggle the visibility of the console and clear its messages.
- **Customizable Layout**: Resize the navigation area and console by dragging the edges. The layout persists across app launches.
- **Dark and Light Modes**: The app automatically adapts to light or dark mode based on the system settings.

## Requirements

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.0 or later
- macOS 12.0 or later

## Installation

Clone this repo and build using XCODE15+                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                    This also has Advanced features such as SavedStates to remember the previous state of all the user interactions when reopening.
                                                                                                                                                                                    -> It was difficult to implement it and I honestly had to do alot of google search and stackoverflow to make it work. But I still don't understand most of the code of its implementation                    
                                                                                                                                                                                    -> Dark Mdoe :
                                                                                                                                                                                        Dark mode is also implemented as an advanced feature
